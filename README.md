# Predict Housing Prices

## Project Idea
The project aims to predict housing prices based on various factors such as the number of rooms, bathrooms, amenities, etc.

## Front End Idea
We plan to develop a website where users can input the number of rooms, bathrooms, amenities, and other relevant information, and the website will predict the price based on that data.

## Machine Learning Technique
We will use linear regression for the machine learning aspect of the project. This will help us model the relationship between the input features and the housing prices.

## Programming Language
We will primarily use Python for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model development. However, we'll also utilize TensorFlow for Java for certain aspects.

## Dataset
We will use the following dataset for training and testing our model: [Housing Price Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sukhmandeepsinghbrar/housing-price-dataset/data)
